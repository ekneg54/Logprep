Labeler
-------

Parameter
^^^^^^^^^

type
~~~~

The value `labeler` chooses the processor type Labeler, which will be described here in greater detail.

schema
~~~~~~

Path to a labeling schema file (like `/var/git/logprep-rules/labeling/schema.json`).

include_parent_labels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the option is deactivated (`off`) only labels defined in a rule will be activated.
Otherwise, also allowed labels in the path to the *root* of the corresponding category of a label will be added.
This allows to search for higher level labels if this option was activated in the rule.

rules
~~~~~

List of directory paths with rule files, i.e.:

  * /var/git/logprep-rules/rules/
  * /var/git/other-rules/rules/
  * /var/git/additional-rules/rules/

Here directories can be defined from which rule files will be loaded.
An arbitrary amount of rule directories can be given.
However, the processing time increases with the addition of more rules.

Labeling-Schema and validating Rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The validation of schemata and rules can be started separately by executing:

..  code-block:: bash

    PYTHONPATH="." python3 logprep/util/schema_and_rule_checker.py $LABELING_SCHEMA $RULES

Where :code:`$LABELING_SCHEMA` is the path to a labeling schema file and :code:`$RULES` is the path to a directory with rule files.

Example
^^^^^^^

..  code-block:: yaml
    :linenos:

    - labelername:
        type: labeler
        schema: tests/testdata/labeler_rules/labeling/schema.json
        include_parent_labels: on
        rules:
            - tests/testdata/labeler_rules/rules/

Parameter
^^^^^^^^^

type
~~~~

The value `normalizer` chooses the processor type Normalizer, which will be described here in greater detail.

specific_rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

List of directory paths with rule files that are specific for some event IDs.
These rules are being executed before generic rules, i.e.:

  * /var/git/logprep-rules/normalizer_rules/specific/
  * /var/git/other-rules/normalizer_rules/specific/

generic_rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

List of directory paths with generic rule files that can match multiple event types.
These rules are being executed after specific rules, i.e.:

One file is created for each day where there was at least one match.

write_period
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Period to wait before a file with grok pattern match counts will be written.
Setting this value very low can have a drastic impact on the performance,
since it requires a file lock and reading from and writing to disc.

lock_file_path
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Domain Resolver
---------------

Parameter
^^^^^^^^^

type
~~~~

The value `domain_resolver` chooses the processor type DomainResolver, which will be described here in greater detail.

~~~~~

List of directory paths with rule files, i.e.:

  * /var/git/logprep-rules/domain_resolver_rules/

~~~~~~~~~~~

Path to JSON file with rule tree matcher config.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Path to a file with a list of top-level domains (like https://publicsuffix.org/list/public_suffix_list.dat).

domain_resolver.timeout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Timeout for resolving of domains.

domain_resolver.hash_salt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A salt that is used for hashing.

domain_resolver.max_caching_days
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Number of days a domains is cached after the last time it appeared.
This caching reduces the CPU load of Logprep (no demanding encryption must be performed repeatedly) and the load on subsequent components (i.e. Logstash or Elasticsearch).
Setting the caching days to Null deactivates the caching.
In case the cache size has been exceeded (see `domain_resolver.max_cached_domains`_), the oldest cached pseudonyms will be discarded first.
Thus, it is possible that a domain is re-added to the cache before max_caching_days has elapsed if it was discarded due to the size limit.

domain_resolver.max_cached_domains
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The maximum number of cached domains.
One cache entry requires ~250 Byte, thus 10 million elements would require about 2.3 GB RAM.
The cache is not persisted.
Restarting Logprep does therefore clear the cache.

~~~~~~~~~~~

Path to JSON file with rule tree matcher config.

tld_lists
~~~~~~~~~

Optional list of path to files with top-level domain lists (like https://publicsuffix.org/list/public_suffix_list.dat).
If no path is given a default list will be retrieved online and cached in a local directory. For local files the path
has to be given with :code:`file:///path/to/file.dat`.

tagging_field_name
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Optional configuration field that defines into which field in the event the informational tags should be written to.
If this field is not present it defaults to :code:`tags`. More about the tags can be found in the introduction of the

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Path to a YML file or a list of paths to YML files with dictionaries of IPs.
It is used by the Predetector to throw alerts if one of the IPs is found in fields that were defined in a rule.

It uses IPs or networks in the CIDR format as keys and can contain expiration dates in the ISO format as values.
If a value is empty, then there is no expiration date for the IP check.
If a checked IP is covered by an IP and a network in the dictionary (i.e. IP 127.0.0.1 and network 127.0.0.0/24 when checking 127.0.0.1),
then the expiration date of the IP is being used.

Example
^^^^^^^

..  code-block:: yaml
    :linenos:

    123.123.123.123: 2077-08-31T16:47+00:00

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A Kafka-topic for pseudonyms.
These are not the pseudonymized events, but just the pseudonyms with the encrypted real values.

max_caching_days
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Number of days a pseudonym is cached after the last time it appeared.
This caching reduces the CPU load of Logprep (no demanding encryption must be performed repeatedly) and the load on subsequent components (i.e. Logstash or Elasticsearch).
Setting the caching days to Null deactivates the caching.
In case the cache size has been exceeded (see max_cached_pseudonyms), the oldest cached pseudonyms will be discarded first.
Thus, it is possible that a pseudonym is re-added to the cache before max_caching_days has elapsed if it was discarded due to the size limit.

max_cached_pseudonyms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The maximum number of cached pseudonyms.
One cache entry requires ~250 Byte, thus 10 million elements would require about 2.3 GB RAM.
The cache is not persisted.
Restarting Logprep does therefore clear the cache.

~~~~~~~~

Path to a file with a list of top-level domains (i.e. https://publicsuffix.org/list/public_suffix_list.dat).

Clusterer
----------

Parameter
^^^^^^^^^

type
~~~~

The value `clusterer` chooses the processor type Clusterer, which will be described here in greater detail.
The log clustering is mainly developed for Syslogs, unstructured and semi-structured logs.
The clusterer calculates a log signature based on the message field.
The log signature is calculated with heuristic and deterministic rules.
The idea of a log signature is to extract a subset of the constant parts of a log and to delete the dynamic parts.
If the fields syslog.facility and event.severity are in the log, then they are prefixed to the log signature.

Logs are only clustered if at least one of the following criteria is fulfilled:

..  code-block:: yaml

    Criteria 1: { "message": "A sample message", "tags": ["clusterable", ...], ... }
    Criteria 2: { "message": "A sample message", "clusterable": true, ... }
    Criteria 3: { "message": "A sample message", "syslog": { "facility": <number> }, "event": { "severity": <string> }, ... }
